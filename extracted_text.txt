Here 5 Root Locus branches are diverging from same point, this can possible only when if we have 5 poles in the system at the same point because Root Locus branch departs from open loop pole and

Number of Root Locus branches = Number of open loop poles or Number of zero (Whichever is greater).

Here, there are 5 multiple Real poles, and matching with option (A).

The frequency response H(f) of a linear time- invariant system has magnitude as shown in the figure.

The root-locus plot of a closed-loop system with unity negative feedback and transfer function KG(s) in the forward path is shown in the figure. Note that K is varied from 0 to  .

Statement I: The system is necessarily a pure delay system for inputs which are bandlimited to –

f    

.

Select the transfer function G(s) that results in the root-locus plot of the closed-loop system as shown in the figure.

Statement II: For any wide-sense stationary input process with power spectral density SX(f), the output power spectral density SY(f) obeys SY(f) = SX(f) for – f    
