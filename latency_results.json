        "response": "The solution calculates the probability of error (Pe) for a channel with two possible symbols ($X_A$ and $X_B$). It finds the threshold voltage ($V_{th}$) by comparing the two conditional probability density functions. The Pe is then calculated as the sum of errors when transmitting each symbol, resulting in 0.367."

        "response": "Here's an explanation of the solution in fewer words:\n\nThe goal is to minimize the mean square quantization error. Two choices are considered: one where x<0 maps to \u03b1 and others to \u03b2, and vice versa.\n\nFor x<0, f(x) = (1/4)x + 1/2, and for x\u22650, f(x) = 0.5.\n\nMSQ is the average of the squared differences between the input signal and its quantized version.\n\nTo minimize MSQ, NQ is calculated by integrating the squared difference between the signal and the quantized version.\n\nFor x<0, NQ = (1/2)(x - \u03b2)^2 dx.\n\nBy minimizing NQ, it's found that \u03b2 = -2/3.\n\nSimilarly for \u03b1:\n\nMSQ = [(1 - \u03b1)^2/(2) dx.\n\nBy minimizing MSQ, it's found that \u03b1 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the answer is: \u03b1 - \u03b2 = (1/2) - (-2/3) = 7/6."

        "response": "The solution calculates the electric charge enclosed within a cubical region by integrating the electric displacement density vector. It shows that the charge density vector is proportional to x^2 and y^2, so the total charge enclosed is the sum of these components' contributions."
